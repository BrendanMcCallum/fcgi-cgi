.SH DESCRIPTION
fcgi-cgi is a FastCGI application to run normal cgi applications. It doesn't
make CGI applications faster, but it allows you to run them on a different
host and with different user permissions (without the need for suexec).
.P
lighttpd2 won't have a mod_cgi, so you need this FastCGI wrapper to be
able to execute standard cgi applications like mailman and cgit.
.P
nginx recommends something similar, they implemented the wrapper in Perl:
http://wiki.nginx.org/NginxSimpleCGI
.P
For running you probably want spawn-fcgi (http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/spawn-fcgi)
.SH EXAMPLE
Example usage:

spawn-fcgi -n -s /var/run/fastcgi-cgi.sock -u www-default -U www-data -- /usr/bin/fcgi-cgi
